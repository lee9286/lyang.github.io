Lin Yang is a professor in the Department of Advanced Manufacturing and Robotics, College of Engineering at Peking University. His research interest lies in fundamental understanding of energy carrier transport through micro/nanostructures and its application for sustainable energy technologies. He leads the Functional Thermal Lab, which investigats the thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties at the smallest length scale to establish fundamental understanding of thermal energy carrier transport, and also leverages this fundamental knowledge to accelerate the development of efficient functional devices and systems across wide temperature regimes, which could help reduce carbon emission and secure our energy needs in the future.
